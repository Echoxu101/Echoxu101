- ⭐⭐⭐**I am hiring for Venmo Engineering Team**⭐⭐⭐
   The Venmo team at PayPal is looking for mobile Android and IOS Software Engineers to join our engineering teams in Austin, Chicago and Scottsdale.

   “Just Venmo me.” You may have heard—or used—this phrase before. Venmo has reached verb status, becoming synonymous with “to pay back.” But Venmo isn’t just about transactions. It’s about interactions. It’s where your money finds meaning as you share, connect, and split purchases with friends. People love sending money and paying with Venmo, and we've come a long way from our humble beginnings as a P2P app. Millions of users have now also made products such as the Venmo Debit Card, Venmo Checkout, Venmo Credit Card, Crypto on Venmo (and more) a part of their financial lives, and there’s so much more we can do as their go-to for fast, safe, social payments.

  How will you create an impact in this role? As a mobile Engineer, your expertise will shape technical standards and best practices across Venmo and PayPal. You'll be the guiding force, ensuring that our engineering endeavors are not just robust but also aligned with our strategic goals.

  We’re not just building a product; we’re creating an experience that our users will love.
